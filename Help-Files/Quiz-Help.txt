Quiz Help

Pressing the ‘New Quiz’ button brings up the level selection menu where you may choose a level. Once you choose one of the levels a quiz will start! You will have two chances per word to get it correct.

Pressing the ‘Review Quiz’ button does the same as the ‘New Quiz’ button but you are instead tested on words you have failed, gotten wrong after both attempts in the ‘New Quiz’ mode!
