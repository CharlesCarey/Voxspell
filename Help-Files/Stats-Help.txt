Stats Help

Pressing the ‘View Stats’ button will show you all the statistics for every level. Each level’s statistics are stored in its own tab. You can sort the statistics by alphabetical order, or by mastered, failed and faulted rates if you click on the column titles!

Pressing the ‘Clear Stats’ button will clear all of your attempt history for every level you have done quizzes for. It will also clear all the word lists you have loaded in. Don’t worry! The levels you have unlocked will stay unlocked!
