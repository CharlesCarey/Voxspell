Open terminal in current directory

To compile the program:
> ./compile.sh (Note: The program is already compiled, running immediately without compile is fine)

To run the program after compilation:
> ./run.sh

To do both in one click (for the very lazy):
> ./compex.sh

Alternatively double click on compile.sh and execute.sh scripts.

Program built using java-1.7 and jfxrt.jar version 1.7.
