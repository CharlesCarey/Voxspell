Open terminal in current directory

To compile the program:
> ./compile.sh (Note: The program is already compiled, running immediately without compile is fine)

To run the program after compilation:
> ./run.sh

To do both in one click (for the very lazy):
> ./compex.sh

Alternatively double click on compile.sh and execute.sh scripts.

Program built using java-1.7 and jfxrt.jar version 1.7.
.java and .class files in /src

If you are trying to run Voxspell on Linux on your own computer then you may have to use the compex-1.8 script using ‘bash compex-1.8’. This will run the program but may generate some weird error printouts to the common line and the video may not work. The full program will run using ‘./compex.sh’ on the lab computers. If reviewing on your own computer please say which script you used so that if you do report any bugs I can know if they are part of the program or just from using the 1.8 script.
