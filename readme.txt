Open terminal in current directory

To compile the program:
> ./compile.sh (Note: The program is already compiled, running immediately without compile is fine)

To run the program after compilation:
> ./run.sh

To do both in one click (for the very lazy):
> ./compex.sh

Alternatively double click on compile.sh and execute.sh scripts.

Program built using java-1.7 and jfxrt.jar version 1.7.
.java and .class files in /src

If you are trying to run Voxspell on Linux on your own computer then you may have to use the compex-1.8 script using ‘bash compex-1.8’. This will run the program but may generate some weird error printouts to the command line and the video may not work, as the program is designed to work in UG4. The full program will run using ‘./compex.sh’ on the lab computers. If reviewing on your own computer please say which script you used so that if you do report any bugs I can know if they are part of the program or just from using the 1.8 script.
